# smart-openehr-client
This is an early exploration of a `smart-on-openehr`client. The main purpose is a component to be used when integrating the `Open DIPS platform` and it will be a client for all openEHR CDR's supporting the `smart-on-openehr` paradigm. 

**WARNING**: The library is very early alpha testing version. Not to be used for any production code or real application development.
